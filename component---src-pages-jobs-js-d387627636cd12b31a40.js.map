However, the use cases are virtually limitless, such as simplifying sending\n                cryptocurrency, storing an avatar and profile information (think gravatar) that web3 apps will pick up\n                and use automatically.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"prelede\">\n                Best of all, the protocol is decentralised, censorship-resistant, and owned by anyone that holds the\n                $ENS token.
